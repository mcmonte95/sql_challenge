# sql_challenge

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

### Repository Guide:
This repository contains 2 main components:
  1. A folder called 'EmployeeSQL' which contains 3 files:
  - A SQL file called 'schema_sql_challenge.sql' which is what was used to create the tables and link the data together
  - A SQL file called 'query_sql_challenge.sql' which is used to query the tables after creation and answer 8 specific questions
  - PNG file called 'ERD_sql_challenge.png' which is athe Entity Relationship Diagram for the database 
  2. A 'Resources' folder which contains the 6 raw csv files that were imported into the database after the tables were created
